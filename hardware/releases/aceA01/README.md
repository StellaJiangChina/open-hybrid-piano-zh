# Analog Condition Equalize (ACE) "A" - Version 0.1

Identical to ACE A 0.0 with the following changes:
* Removed ground plane because it makes soldering more difficult (thermal) and adds little benefit.
* For headers placed on back of board, corrected the footprints to match.
* Adjusted some of the footprint label locations.

No functional changes.
