# Hammer Position Sensor (HPS) Version 0.4

To manufacture a board, send the files in [hps04_gerber/](hps04_gerber/) to a PCB manufacturer.

## Introduction

Originally, the HPS PCB was for hammers.
However, the board also works for dampers. 
Not changing the name because many circuit boards have already been built.

Version 0.4 uses fixed resistors which trades lower accuracy for lower cost.

## Features

### I/O
* Power input.
* Analog output signal, with range set by resistors.
* Ground.

### Size
* 1.5 inches long.
* 0.4 inches wide.

### Capabilties
* CNY70 sensor.
* Fixed resistors.
* All resistors are through hole.
