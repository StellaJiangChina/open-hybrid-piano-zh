# Hammer Position Sensor (HPS) Verion 0.6

Originally, the HPS PCB was for hammers.
However, the sensor also works for dampers. 
Not changing the name because many circuit boards have already been built.

## Requirements

### I/O
* Power input.
* Analog output signal, with range set by resistors.
* Ground.

### Capabilties
* CNY70 sensor.
* Trimming resistor to fine tune output voltage maximum value.
* All resistors are surface mount packages.
