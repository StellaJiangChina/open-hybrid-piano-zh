# Hammer Position Sensor (HPS) Version 0.6

To manufacture a board, send the files in [hps06_gerber/](hps06_gerber/) to a PCB manufacturer.

## Introduction

Originally, the HPS PCB was for hammers.
However, the sensor also works for dampers. 
Not changing the name because many circuit boards have already been built.
