# Hammer Position Sensor (HPS) Version 0.7

## Introduction

Originally, the HPS PCB was for hammers.  However, the sensor also works for dampers.  Not changing the name because many circuit boards have already been built.

Version 0.7 changes the header pin order. This provides a better physical match to some mainboards.

## Features

### I/O
* Power input.
* Analog output signal, with range set by resistors.
* Ground.

### Size
* 1.5 inches long.
* 0.4 inches wide.

### Capabilties
* CNY70 sensor.
* Trimming resistor to fine tune output voltage maximum value.
* All resistors are surface mount packages.

### Manufacturing

To manufacture a board, send the files in (NOT POSTED YET).

Use the bill of materials file that matches the mainboard connected to the HPS.
