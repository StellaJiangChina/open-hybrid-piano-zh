# Hammer Position Sensor (HPS) specification

Historically this was for hammers. However, the sensor is also used for dampers. Not changing the name because many circuit boards have already been built.

## Requirements

### I/O
* 3.3V power input.
* Ground.
* Analog output signal, with range set by resistors.

### Capabilties
* CNY70 sensor.
* Maximum current draw < 15mA.
* Fixed resistor and trimming resistor versions.
