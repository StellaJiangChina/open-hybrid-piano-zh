# Tools for Building a Stem Piano

## Recommended

### 1.0mm Flat Head Screwdriver
Need if using a version of Hammer Position Sensor (HPS) with a trimming resistor. Use screwdriver to adjust the resistor.

### Digital Multimeter
Useful for checking power supply voltages, HPS output voltage to the analog-to-digital converter(s), pullup voltage values, and other voltages.

If using a version of HPS with a trimming resistor, the ohmmeter of a multimeter is useful for checking the final trimming resistance value.

An ohmmeter is also helpful to verify correct parts on boards.

### Woodworking and Mechanics Tools

For building the frame, drilling sensor holes, mounting sensors, installing the hammer stop bar, etc.

## Optional

### Soldering

If hand soldering any components, a complete soldering setup is needed.

### Oscilloscope

Use an oscilloscope to check time-varying signals. For example, the sampling rate and processor burden.

### Breadboard Power Supply

A small 3.3V power supply module is useful for powering HPS if testing individual output voltages. These are typically powered by a computer USB connection and are inexpensive.
