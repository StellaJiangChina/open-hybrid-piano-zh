# Hybrid MIDI Digital Piano - Status and Milestones

## Status

The Stem Piano G hardware and firmware in the repository works and is a very playable piano.

Depending on pianist skill, the piano accuracy may need further improvement. For example, the action frame and sensor mechanical system tolerances cause note-to-note dynamics variation. Also, sensor errors have been improved but are not zero.
