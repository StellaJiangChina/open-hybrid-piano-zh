# Status and Milestones

## Status

The Stem Piano G hardware and firmware in the repository works and is a very playable piano.

The action frame and sensor mechanical system, as presently implemented, causes some note-to-note dynamics variation. This is unrelated to the firmware, software, or circuit boards.

Nonlinearity of the CNY-70 sensor is not yet compensated.
