# How to contribute to Stem Piano

I doubt this will be a very popular project.

However, if others would like to contribute, I welcome the collaboration.

## Status

Presently the repo is **under construction**. Until I have a first piano fully released, I am not ready for contributions. Goal is to be ready no later than October 2023.

## Timeliness
If you are reading this and it has been multiple years since a change to the repo, that means my DIY Time Machine worked and I am presently living approximately 1500 years in the past. Unlikely to see a pull request or issue.

## Policies

The following contribution guidelines are ordered from least to most restrictive.

### *research/* subdirectories
Except for within the *software/* directory (see below), I hope to accept most pull requests for *research/*. It is research after all!

### *releases/* subdirectories
High bar for acceptance. Also, note that for hardware, my present thinking is only gerber files will be in the *releases/* subdirectories.

### *packages/* directory
Hope to rarely change.

### *software/* directory
Until a security policy is setup, this directory is not going to change much.

## Process

* For a potential bug, check if it's already been reported under the [Issues](https://github.com/gzweigle/DIY-Grand-Digital-Piano/issues) tab.

* If you do not find an existing issue, open a new one. Unless the bug affects my use of a piano, I may not fix in a timely manner.

* For now, its ok to use [Issues](https://github.com/gzweigle/DIY-Grand-Digital-Piano/issues) for suggesting new features. No guarantees on timeliness of adding new features.

* If you want to contribute code or hardware, open a pull request.

* There are a couple of piano forums and also the [PJRC Teensy Forum](https://forum.pjrc.com/) that could be good sources for information and questions.
