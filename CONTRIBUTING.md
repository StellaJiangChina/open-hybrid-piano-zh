# How to contribute to Stem Piano

The *pianos/* directory at the top level of the repository is a great place to learn the codebase. Each piano in *pianos/* links to all code required to build a complete piano.

## Timeliness
If you are reading this and it has been multiple years since a change to the repo, that means my DIY Time Machine worked and I am presently living approximately 1500 years in the past. Unlikely to see a pull request or issue.

## Guidelines

Keep the repo as small as possible. Large files may not be accepted.

The file headers are already too long. Please add as little as possible.

If you build a piano, please share about it in the Show & Tell Discussions of this repository.

## Policies

The following contribution guidelines are ordered from least to most restrictive.

### *research/* subdirectories
Except for within the *software/* directory (see below), few restrictions.

### *releases/* subdirectories
High bar for changes. For hardware, potentially only gerber files will be in the *releases/* subdirectories.

### *pianos/* directory
Rarely changes once a piano is done.

### *software/* directory
Until a security policy is setup, this directory is not going to change much.

## Process

* For a potential bug, check if it's already been reported under the [Issues](https://github.com/gzweigle/DIY-Grand-Digital-Piano/issues) tab.

* If you do not find an existing issue, open a new one. Unless the bug affects my use of a piano, I may not fix in a timely manner.

* For now, its ok to use [Issues](https://github.com/gzweigle/DIY-Grand-Digital-Piano/issues) for suggesting new features. No guarantees on timeliness of adding new features.

* If you want to contribute code or hardware, open a pull request.

* There are a couple piano forums and https://forum.pjrc.com/ that could be good sources for information and questions.
